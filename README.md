# Coding Challenge (Front-end)

### Introduction 
As a coding test I got a challenge that was designed to explore my React & SCSS frontend skills. I had to create a simple SPA based off the provided mockup and had to do a few API calls to a public web API.


### The challenge
You have to complete the test and write any necessary code so that the discover page looks like this [mockup] designs. All the images/icons you need are already imported and you can find them under the images folder. 

The discover page should enable the user to search for movies as keywords are typed into the search bar. Functionality for filtering does not need to be implemented, however the filter categories should still be expandable/collapsable upon clicking. On mobile devices, the navigation bar should slide in from left to right when the user clicks on the hamburger icon, and back when the user clicks on a close icon or outside the SideBar. In addition, you have to add all the responsive stylesheets for the app to run smoothly on mobile devices.

Movie data can be queried via:
